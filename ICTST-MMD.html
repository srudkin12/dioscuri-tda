        <font size="+2"> 4th (Virtual) International Conference on Trauma Surgery Technology 2022, dedicated to Mathematics in Medical Diagnostics </font>
        <br>
        The conference will be held virtually on 23 April 2022.
        </center>

        <br>
        <br>
        
        The programme is available <a href="documents/ICTST-MMD/2022-ICTST-MMD-virtual-programme-v5.pdf">available here</a>.

        <br>
        <br>

        The aim of the conference is to bring together medical practitioners who would like to take advantage of advanced mathematical techniques
        in their clinical work with mathematicians and computer scientists who can provide methods and implementations that have the potential to
        make a difference in clinical practice. We are interested in both labelled medical datasets of various modalities, as well as the methods
        to extract their signatures. The output of such methods should be easy to integrate with tools of statistics, machine learning, and
        artificial intelligence to provide clinicians with reliable answers to the unsolved medical questions of our time.

        <br>
        <br>

        If you are interested in participating in our meeting, please send us an abstract of your talk. Please follow the text structure
        <a href="documents/ICTST-MMD/structure.odt">available here</a> and email before 31 March 2022 your abstract to WolframAndreas.Bosbach (at) Insel.ch
