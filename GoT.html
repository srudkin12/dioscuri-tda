This webpage offers a brief introduction to the Game of Trees (GoT). It is a combinatorial game aiming to expose our players to the basics of graph theory.
Graphs are abstract representations of various objects. Each graph consists of vertices that are connected via edges. Vertices in that instance may represent cities in a given country, while edges, the roads  between them.
Graphs may have single, or multiple connected components. If there is a vertex (city) that cannot be reached from another vertex (city), that means that those two vertices are in different connected components. Graphs may possess cycles. Every two vertices that
can be reched via two different paths lies in a cycle. Trees are a special kind of graphs having a single connected component and no cycles.
<br>
<br>
Trees are the main objects of our game. Trees have the unique property that, given any two nodes, there is a unique path between them. Each such path
can be assigned with a length defined as the number of edges in this unique path. Now, suppose we are given a tree. For every pair of points, let us
measure the length of the path between them. And let us report the number of all paths of all lengths. Can we get back the tree we startedd from based only on number of paths of different lenght? Play to find out!

        You can find the tutorial of the game in the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_x8itPfxRs&ab_channel=Pawe%C5%82D%C5%82otko">Youtube video</a>.
