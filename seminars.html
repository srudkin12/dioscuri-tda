			Tamal Dey (Purdue): Computing Generalized Rank Invariant for 2-parameter Persistence Modules via Zigzag Persistence<br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b> The notion of generalized rank invariant in the context of multiparameter persistence has become an important ingredient for defining interesting homological structures such as generalized persistence diagrams. Naturally, computing these rank invariants efficiently is a prelude to computing any of these derived structures efficiently. We show that the generalized rank over a finite interval I of a Z^2-indexed persistence module M is equal to the generalized rank of the zigzag module that is induced on a certain path in I tracing mostly its boundary. Hence, we can compute the generalized rank over I by computing the barcode of the zigzag module obtained by restricting the bifiltration inducing M to that path. If I has t points, this computation takes O(t^\omega) time where \omega\in[2,2.373) is the exponent of matrix multiplication. Among others, we apply this result to obtain an improved algorithm for the following problem. Given a bifiltration inducing a module M, determine whether M is interval decomposable and, if so, compute all intervals supporting its summands.

			Anastasios Stefanou (Uni Bremen): Multiparameter persistence meets Gröbner bases.<br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b> Ordinary persistent homology extends from one parameter to multiparameter filtrations. The resulting algebraic methodology is called multiparameter persistent homology. Although multiparameter persistence modules of finite type admit a unique decomposition into indecomposables, the indecomposable modules do not always have the structure of a generalized interval module. Thus, to study these multigraded module structures one has to use alternative algebraic tools to present them. One such tool is called minimal free resolutions. A known result in homological algebra is that any $N^n$-graded module admits a unique minimal free resolution (up to a non-canonical notion of equivalence). Although these resolutions are not unique for the module in the standard sense, there are ways on which one can utilize the theory of Gröbner bases to explicitly construct a minimal free resolution for the persistent module of a given multifiltration. The output minimal free resolution depends on (i) choosing a monomial order in the polynomial ring R:=K[x1,\ldots,x_n] (e.g. the lexicographic order) and (ii) on other things, e.g. choosing an ordering on the simplices of the input multi-filtered complex. In this talk I will give an introduction on Gröbner bases over R^l, and discuss how Gröbner bases can be useful in multiparameter persistence.</li>

			Kunal Dutta (University of Warsaw): On Dimensionality Reduction for Persistent Homology<br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b> Given a point cloud in a high-dimensional space, we are interested in computing
the persistent homology of the Cech filtration while avoiding the curse of dimensionality, and
investigate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction for this problem.
This line of work was initiated by Sheehy [SoCG 2014] who showed that any
map preserving pairwise distances between points up to a $(1\pm \varepsilon)$
factor, also preserves the Cech filtration up to a $(1 \pm 4\varepsilon)$ factor.
We'll follow the work of Sheehy [2014] and Lotz [Proc. Roy. Soc., 2019], before
arriving at the result of [Arya, Boissonnat, D., Lotz, J. App. Comp. Topol., 2021],
which answers an open question of Sheehy regarding dimensionality reduction for
persistent homology computed using the \emph{$k$-distance}, or \emph{distance to a measure}.
We show that any linear transformation that preserves pairwise distances up
to a $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$ multiplicative factor, must preserve the persistent homology
of the &#268;ech filtration, computed using the $k$-distance,
up to a factor of $(1 - \varepsilon)^{-1}$. Our results also hold for
the Vietoris-Rips and Delaunay filtrations for the $k$-distance, as well
as the &#268;ech filtration for the approximate $k$-distance of Buchet et al.
[Comput. Geom., 2016].
We'll also look at several extensions of this result, for point sets (i) lying in a
region of bounded Gaussian width or (ii) on a low-dimensional manifold,
obtaining the target dimension bounds of Lotz [Proc. Roy. Soc., 2019] and
Clarkson [Proc. SoCG, 2008 ] respectively.

			Niklas Hellmer: Bottleneck Profiles and Prokhorov Metrics for Persistence Modules<br/>

			<b>Abstract:</b> In TDA, Bottleneck and interleaving distances and their variants are common tools to compare persistence diagrams or modules. However, they only capture the single, most extreme difference. We introduce bottleneck profiles, a way to study all the differences at varying scales. Algebraically speaking, this construction can be thought of measuring how far two persistence modules are from being interleaved. In addition, one easily obtains a rich family of (extended pseudo)metrics for persistence modules, mimicking the classical Prokhorov metric from probability theory. As an application, we describe proxies for the Wasserstein distance, which allow for fast computations.</li>

			Simon Rudkin (Swansea): Hidden in Plain Sight: The Real Messages of Economic Data
<br/>
<b>Abstract:</b> Recognising the powerful messages that may be drawn from the shape of data, we ask how inference on well-studied datasets in economics and finance may be enriched through topological data analysis. Examples considered include the application of ball mapper algorithms in credit scoring, regional growth trajectories, analysis of stock returns and to the political economy of Brexit. In each case we demonstrate how anomaly phenomenon are better understood when viewed through the multidimensional lens; policy and practice then being more effectively directed as a consequence. Discussing the ways in which developments of theory may support research agendas across economics and finance, we signpost where the tools of TDA themselves can be developed to embolden the synergies between disciplines. Consequentially, we signpost an exciting research agenda that further reveals the information that an inability to meaningfully capture the multidimensional nature of data had veiled for so long.</li>

			Wolfram Bosbach: TDA in medical engineering<br/>

			<b>Abstract:</b>Medical research can greatly benefit from advanced mathematical methods. There are patterns of higher order in human anatomy which are not intuitively recognisable by the human eye. Trabecular bone, neuronal networks in the brain, or lung bronchi exhibit interconnectivities which allow analyses about their physiological or pathological state. Numerical finite elements can extend pattern analyses and give insights into mechanical tissue behaviour. Radiology is the medical field which can provide 3-dimensional imaging of anatomical body parts. 
Funded by the DFG, we are now working towards applying topological data analysis (TDA) to existing and new classification problems.

			Davide Gurnari: Distributed algorithms for Euler Characteristic Curves<br/>

			<b>Abstract:</b> The Euler characteristic of a simplicial complex is the alternate sum of its Betti number, or equivalently the alternating sum of the number of simplices of following dimensions. For a filtered complex the Euler Characteristic Curve is a function that assigns an Euler number to each filtration level. ECCs are closely related to persistence diagrams via the fundamental theorem of persistent homology and stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance can be proven under certain conditions.
The first part of this talk we will introduce the concept of ECC and prove its stability with respect to the 1-Wasserstein distance. In the second part we will present new techniques to compute the ECC of filtered Vietoris-Rips complexes. By following a distributed approach, the contributions to the ECC can be computed locally without having to explicitly build up the whole complex. This allows us to significatively reduce both time and memory requirements, giving us the opportunity to tackle much larger datasets compared to, for instance, persistent homology. An implementation of such algorithms is available as a scikit-learn-compatible Python package. Finally, we will discuss how such ideas and algorithms can be adapted to work in the multiparameter persistence setting.</li>

			Micha&#322; Lipi&#324;ski: Morse-Conley-Forman theory for generalized combinatorial multivector fields on finite topological spaces<br/>

			<b>Abstract:</b> In the talk, I will present a generalization of the theory of multivector fields which can be seen as a combinatorial counterpart of vector fields induced by continuous dynamical systems. The theory has its roots in the theory of combinatorial vector fields by Robin Forman and was later extended by Marian Mrozek to multivector fields for Lefschetz complexes.
Our generalization involves three fundamental changes, which will be explained during the talk. Consequently, the theory becomes more flexible and handy in applications. Moreover, we can introduce a new interpretation of a multivector as a dynamical "black box."
With the new settings, we define combinatorial counterparts of multiple objects from the classical theory of dynamical systems, among others: isolated invariant set, index pair, Conley index, limit set, attractor, or Morse decomposition. We also show that the desirable properties as additivity of a Conley index and Morse inequalities hold.
Furthermore, we use persistent homology to study the robustness of the structure of Morse sets. In particular, we construct a zigzag persistence module for Morse decomposition for multivector fields.
Finally, we will present some numerical experiments based on the presented theory.</li>

			Jan F. Senge: Topological descriptors for surface roughness of shot peened surfaces<br/>
			

			<b>Abstract:</b> Surface topography and roughness evaluation plays an important role in many problems such as friction, contact deformation or coat adhesion. Impact surface treatments can be used to improve the properties of the treated surface in the cases mentioned. Different roughness parameters like the arithmetic average height deviation, root mean square height or skewness are used to describe the topography of a surface and constitute the most used features to describe changes occurred during impact treatment. Depending on the surface treatment process considered, standard roughness parameters may struggle to exhibit differences between surface samples of the same material at different stages of the process. As an extension the work done to improve existing methods and find new descriptors, we consider methods from computational topology, namely persistent homology to capture meaningful geometric features of the surface and use that to construct new surface roughness parameters better able to distinguish surface samples. Furthermore, invariants such as the persistence diagram have been studied extensively in the last years and provide a rich structure which can be exploited using a plethora of different machine learning techniques. In the talk, I give an introduction into existing standards for surface roughness measurement and compare how well  persistence-based parameters perform for classification and clustering tasks in the case of the shot peening surface treatment process opposed to conventional roughness parameters mentioned in these standards.</li>

			Anastasios Stefanou: Persistent Homology of Phylogenetic Networks<br/>

			<b>Abstract:</b> We devise a hierarchical representation of phylogenetic networks over a set of taxa X, called the cliquegram, which generalizes the dendrogram representation of phylogenetic tree ultrametrics. We show that cliquegrams form a lattice. Furthermore, we show that the cliquegram lattice model is a faithful model for solving the Phylogenetic Network Reconstruction Problem (PNRP): Given a set of trees there is a unique minimal network that contains them. Moreover, we develop a zigzag persistent homology theory for cliquegrams relative to a choice of a taxon x in X, called taxa-decorated persistent homology. Generalizations of these ideas (i.e. the cluttergram) from the setting of networks to the setting of filtrations are also developed. The algorithms implementing those constructions are discussed and their implementations are provided in Python. </li>

			Artem Dudko: On computability and computational complexity of Julia sets.<br/>

			<b>Abstract:</b> In this talk I will give an introduction to computability and computational
			complexity of sets with the focus on Julia sets of polynomials. For a polynomial p(z) its Julia
			set is the set of points on a complex plane near which the iterations of p(z) behave chaotically.
			Roughly speaking, a set is called computable if there is an algorithm which can produce an
			approximation of this set (by a finite set of pixels) with any given precision. Computational
			complexity measures how hard it is to produce such approximations. In the talk I will show that
			already in the class of Julia sets of quadratic polynomials there are various interesting computational phenomena, including:<br/>
			- large classes of functions having Julia sets of low (polynomial) computational complexity;<br/>
			- functions with non-computable Julia sets;<br/>
			- large classes of functions having Julia sets of arbitrarily high computational complexity.</li>

			Austin Lawson (UNC Greensboro): Persistence Curves: A canonical framework for summarizing persistence diagrams</br>
			<b>Abstract:</b> As Topological Data Analysis (TDA) grows in popularity so too does the need
			for topological methods compatible with modern machine learning algorithms.
			The use of machine learning algorithms directly on the space of persistence diagrams is challenging.
			For that reason, transforming these diagrams in a way that is compatible with machine learning is an important topic currently researched in TDA.
			A promising avenue in this vein involves mapping a persistence diagram to a real-valued summary function or vector
			that maintains the topological information contained in the diagram. Inspired by persistent Betti numbers,
			we discover a canonical way to generate these mappings, which we call the Persistence Curve Framework.
			In this talk, we will (1) define the framework and show that subsumes several other recent summary functions including the persistence landscapes;
			(2) explore theoretical results including stability; (3) demonstrate some recent applications using the PC framework including texture analysis,
			time series classification, and skin lesion analysis; and finally (4) we will discuss the future of applications and theoretical development of the framework.</li>

			Rodrigo Azevedo Moreira de Silva: Proteins from Discrete Gauss-Bonnet Perspective  <br/>
			<b>Abstract:</b>
			Proteins are fundamental blocks of life, and their amino-acid sequence
			and geometric structure define their functions. However, the intrinsic
			rules governing their structure are still largely unknown. The emerging
			field of Topological Data Analysis has been contributing to the
			understanding of protein-protein interaction, protein classification,
			and structure. We will show our recent advances in the application of
			Euler Characteristic and local curvature analysis applied to large
			proteins and their molecular dynamics, and the insight about the role of
			high dimensional simplicies for modeling such systems. The technical
			difficulties found in processing the big data required for the modeling,
			as well as perspectives of the application of the discrete formulation
			of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, will also be discussed. </li>
